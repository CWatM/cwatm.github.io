Water Futures and Solutions Initiatives (WFAS)
==============================================

`Water Futures and Solutions Initiatives <http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/water-futures.html>`_ is using a multi-model approach for global climatic, hydro-socioeconomic modeling in order to assess possible futures.
We use three leading global hydrological models H08, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB for estimating water demand and supply. 
This approach is used for a better understanding of the uncertainty and limitations of modeling. 
It provides a degree of confidence in the results an is in-line with the `ISI-MIPS <https://www.isimip.org/>`_ approach of multi-modeling

Nexus Integration - Water Energy Food Environment
=================================================

| In the framework of the `Integrated Solution project <http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchProjects/Nexus_Solutions.html>`_ 
| the Community Water Model (CWATM) will be coupled with the existing IIASA models `MESSAGE <http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/modelsData/MESSAGE/MESSAGE.en.html>`_ and `GLOBIOM <http://www.globiom.org/>`_
| in order to do enhanced water assessments and an improved analysis feedback on water, energy, food and environmental aspects

CWAT and the IIASA global hydro-economic model
==============================================

The Community Water Model will help to develop a next-generation hydro-economic modeling tool that represents the economic trade-offs among water supply technologies and demands. The tool will track water use from all sectors and will identify the least-cost solutions for meeting future water demands under policy constraints.  In addition, the tool will track the energy requirements associated with the water supply system (e.g., desalination and water conveyance) to facilitate the linkage with the energy-economic tool. The tool will also incorporate environmental flow requirements to ensure sufficient water for environmental needs. The new hydro-economic model will be linked to CWATM by GAMS output and input files (gdx-files).
