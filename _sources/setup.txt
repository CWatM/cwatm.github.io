Requirements
------------

Python version
**************

Requirements are a 64 bit `Python 2.7.x version <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/>`_

.. warning:: a 32 bit version is not able to handle the data requirements!

Libraries
*********

Three external libraries are needed:

* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `netCDF4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netCDF4>`_
* `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org>`_

**Windows**

Both libraries can be installed with pip or
downloaded at `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs>`_


PCRaster
******** 

And the PCRASTER library from Faculty of Geosciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands - `Webpage of PCRaster <http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl>`_

**PCRaster installation**

| CWATM is using the PCRaster Python framwork of PCRaster but not the GIS commands.
| But nevertheless it is quite usefull to install a full PCRaster version:

| **Windows**
| `Windows installation guide of PCRaster <http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/quick-start-guide/>`_

| **Linux**
| `Linux installation guide of PCRaster <http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/getting-started/pcraster-on-linux/>`_

.. note:: If it is not possible to install a full version of PCRaster! 
    Copy following files

::

    From: PCRasterFolder\python\pcraster\framework
    
    dynamicBase.py
    dynamicFramework.py
    dynamicPCRasterBase.py
    frameworkBase.py
    shellscript.py
    
    To: CWATM/source/pcraster2	


C++ libraries
-------------

For the computational time demanding parts e.g. routing,
CWATM comes with a C++ library

Compiled versions
*****************

| **Windows and CYGWIN_NT-6.1**
| a compiled version is provided and CWATM is detecting automatically which system is running and which compiled version is needed

| **Linux**
| For Cygwin linux a compiled version *t5cyg.so* is provided in *../source/hydrological_modules/routing_reservoirs/* for version CYGWIN_NT-6.1.
| If you use another cygwin version please compile it by yourself and name it *t5_linux.so*

For Linux Ubuntu a compiled version is provided as *t5_linux.so*. The file is in *../source/hydrological_modules/routing_reservoirs/* 

.. note::
    If you use another Linux version or the compiled version is not working or you have a compiler which produce faster executables please compile a version on your own.


Compiling a version
*******************

C++ sourcecode is in *../source/hydrological_modules/routing_reservoirs/t5.cpp*

**Windows**

A compiled version is provided, but maybe you have a faster compiler than the "Minimalist GNU for Windows" or "Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0" we used.

To compile with g++::

    ..\g++ -c -fPIC -Ofast t5.cpp -o t5.o
    ..\g++ -shared -Ofast -Wl,-soname,t5.so -o t5.so  t5.o
	
To compile with Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0::
 
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\amd64/vcvars64.bat"
    cl /LD /O2 t5.cpp

.. note::

    We used Visual Studio, because it seems to be computational faster
	| the libray used with Windows is named *t5.dll*, if you generate a libray *t5.so* the filename in **../source/management_modules/globals.py** has to be changed!

**Linux**

To compile with g++::

    ..\g++ -c -fPIC -Ofast t5.cpp -o t5_linux.o
    ..\g++ -shared -Ofast -Wl,-soname,t5_linux.so -o t5_linux.so  t5_linux.o
	
	or
	
	..\g++ -c -Ofast t5.cpp -o t5_linux.o
    ..\g++ -shared -Ofast -Wl,-soname,t5_linux.so -o t5_linux.so  t5_linux.o


.. warning:: Please rename your compiled version to t5_linux.so! At the moment the file t5_linux.so is compiled with Ubuntu Linux

Initialisation
==============



CWATM needs to have estimates of the initial state of the internal storage variables, e.g. the amount of water stored in snow, soil, groundwater etc.

There are two possibilities:

1. The initial state of the internal storage variables are unknown and a **first** guess has to be used e.g. all storage variables are half filled.

2. The initial state is known from a previous run, where the variables are stored at a certain time step. This is called **warm start**

The the **warm start** is usful for:

* using a long pre-run to find the steady-state storage of the groundwater storage and use it as initial value

* using the stored variables to shorten the warm-up period

* using the stored variables to restart every day with the values from the pre3vious day (forecasting mode)

Example of soil moisture
------------------------

The next figure shows the impact of different initial condition on the soil moisture of the lower soil.
In one of the simulations the soil is initially almost ompletely saturated. In another simulation the soil is completely dry and the third simulation starts with initial conditions in between the two extremes.

In the beginning the effect of different initial condition can be seen clearly. But after one year the three curves converge. The **memory** of the lower soil goes back for about one year.

For all the initial condition apart from groundwater the memory is about 12 month. That means practically a spin-up of one year is sufficient to habve enough warm-up time.



.. figure:: _static/init_soilmoisture.jpg
    :width: 600px

Figure: Simulation of soil moisture in the lower soil with different initial conditions

For the groundwater zone a longer warm-up period is needed, because of the slow response of groundwater. Here a rather fast reacting groundwater storage is shown with the three curves coverge after two years.

.. figure:: _static/init_groundwater.jpg
    :width: 600px

Figure: Simulation of groundwater storage with different initial conditions



Cold start
----------

For a **cold start** the values of the storage variables are unknown and set to a "first" guess.
A list of variables and their default value for a **cold start** is given below in: :ref:`rst_initialcondition`

Set up a cold start in the settingsfile
***************************************

In the settings file the option: **load_initial** has to be set on **False**

.. literalinclude:: _static/settings1.ini
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:
    :language: ini
    :lines: 145-152

And all the initial conditions is the different sections have to be set to NONE
The values here (if not set to NONE) will overwrite the initial conditions of the general initial condition netCDF file
	
For example:
	
.. literalinclude:: _static/settings1.ini
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:
    :language: ini
    :lines: 332-334

.. note:: It is possible to exclude the warming up period of your model run for further analysis of results by setting the **SpinUp** option

::
 
    [TIME-RELATED_CONSTANTS]
    SpinUp =  01/01/1995 
	
Storing initial variables 
-------------------------

In the settings file the option **save_intitisal** has to be set to **True**

The name of the initial netCDF4 file has to be put in **initsave**

and one or more dates have to be specified in StepInit

.. literalinclude:: _static/settings1.ini
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:
    :language: ini
    :lines: 154-158


	
Warm start
----------

CWATM can write internal variables to a netCDF file for choosen timesteps. These netCDF files can be used as the initial conditions for a suceeding simulation.

This is useful for establishing a steady-state with a long-term run and then using this steady-state for succeding simulations or for an every day run (forecasting mode)

.. warning:: If the parameters are changes after a run(especially the groundwater parameters) the stored initial values do not represent the conditions of the storage variables. Stored initial conditions should **not** be used as initial values for a model run with another set of parameters. If you do this during calibration, you will not be able to reproduce the calibration results!




Set up a cold start in the settingsfile
***************************************

In the settings file the option: **load_initial** has to be set on **True**
And define the name of the netcdf4 file in **initLoad**

.. note:: Use the initial values of the previous day here. E.g. if you run the model from 01/01/2006 use the inital condition from 31/12/2005

.. literalinclude:: _static/settings1.ini
    :linenos:
    :lineno-match:
    :language: ini
    :lines: 145-152

There is also the possibility to set single variables to a certain value (or map)

::

    # INITIAL CONDITIONS (None either 0 or use init file)
    FrostIndexIni = 56.0

Or
	
::

    # INITIAL CONDITIONS (None either 0 or use init file)
    FrostIndexIni = ../frostIndex31122005.map

This will *override* the value of an initial netcdf4 file.
