    **Global climatic, hydro-socioeconomic modeling WAT/WFAS**

    WFaS is using a multi-model approach to assess possible futures.
    We use three leading global hydrological models H08, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB for estimating water demand and supply. 
    This approach is used for a better understanding of the uncertainty and limitations of modeling. 
    It provides a degree of confidence in the results an is in-line with the ISI-MIPS approach of multi-modeling 
	
    **Why a IIASA WAT hydrological model**
	
    Using results of models limits the possibility of tailoring the model to our needs i.e. linking to other IIASA groups (Globiom, Message, Epic, Economic GAMS) or parametrizing scenarios and solution options
    Some problems are anyway only addressed in some model but not all (e.g. groundwater in PCR-GLOBWB)
    The effort of fitting 3 models to solution/options is bigger than to develop a single model
